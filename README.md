Sakai Feeback Tool
==================

This tool allows a Sakai user to report problems with a site's content or
functionality. Reports are sent as emails to the problem site's contact email,
or, if that hasn't been specified, to a user selected site maintainer. In
addition to the two reports, there is a link to an area where you can suggest
new features. This link has to be configured from sakai.properties.
